        <p><strong><em>ingredient</em></strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 heads napa cabbage</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups coarse sea salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>5 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>½ small white onion, minced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean chili powder)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><em>instructions</em></strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Cut cabbages in half lengthwise and trim the ends. Rinse and cut into pieces about 2 inch square. Place cabbage into large resealable bags; sprinkle salt evenly over leaves to coat. Use your hands to rub salt into cabbage. Seal the bags and leave at room temperature for 6 hours.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Rinse cabbage leaves under cold water, at least 2 to 3 times, to remove most of the salt; drain and squeeze out any excess liquid.</p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Place rinsed cabbage in a large container with a tight fitting lid. Stir in fish sauce, green onions, white onion, garlic, sugar, and ginger. Sprinkle Korean chile powder over mixture.; wear plastic gloves to protect your hands and rub chile powder into cabbage leaves until evenly coated.</p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>Seal the container and set in a cool dry place. Leave undisturbed for 4 days. Refrigerate before serving, and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month (if it lasts that long!).</p>
