        <p>A bowl of butternut squash soup</p>
        <p>A smooth, creamy soup made from puréed butternut squash, often enhanced with ingredients like onions, carrots, broth, and spices, and served with toppings such as croutons, fresh herbs, or a swirl of cream.</p>
        <p><strong><em>ingredient</em></strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>½ butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>½ cube chicken bouillon</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground allspice</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><em>instructions</em></strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and thyme and sauté until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Add squash and chicken broth; bring to a simmer, then cook until squash is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Crumble bouillon into the soup. Season with cumin, allspice, salt, and pepper, then remove from heat.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Working in batches, pour soup into a blender, filling no more than halfway. Hold the lid in place with a kitchen towel, then carefully start the blender using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to purée. Pour soup into a serving bowl. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and purée the soup in the pot.</p>
